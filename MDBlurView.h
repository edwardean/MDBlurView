/**
 MDBlurView provides an easy way for your interfaces to incorporate auto-bluring views into your layouts. It provides a greate way to not only place one anywhere, but also to color it, control how much bluring you get, and best of all mask it accordingly.
 
 MDBlurView uses no private APIs, and uses a UINavigationBar internally to get the blur, after stripping it of it's decorations. If for any reason the internal blur views disapear in upcoming releases, the only change will be a lack of blur â€” your UI should otherwise stay unaffected.
 
 @warning Avoid setting the background color directly, and set the backgroundTintColor instead.

 @note Setting an alpha value around 0.5 usually works for bright colors. For darker colors, this value can be set much higher to 0.6 or 0.7.
